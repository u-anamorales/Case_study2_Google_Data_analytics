## Bellabeat Data Abalysis Case Study
#### Google Data Analytics Course

Welcome to my Case Study! This is the final project for the Google Data Analytics Course. I'm pretty excited to share this with you.

In this case study, I am a junior data analyst on the Bellabeat marketing team. My goal is to discover new growth opportunities and contribute to the company's success through the analysis of fitness data on smart devices.

Founded in 2013 by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, Bellabeat has quickly become a major player in the global smart device market. The company's beautifully designed technology provides women with knowledge about their health and habits, thanks to activity, sleep, stress and reproductive her health data collected through apps and smart her wellness products. In this case study, I was tasked with analyzing smart device usage data to understand consumer trends in using non-Bellabeat devices. Insights from this analysis are applied to Bellabeat's customers to achieve the ultimate goal of shaping the company's marketing strategy. The journey begins with asking the right questions, obtaining and preparing relevant data, performing in-depth analysis using **R and ggplot2**, and presenting results through compelling visualizations.
